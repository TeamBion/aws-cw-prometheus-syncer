## Getting Started

* <a href="./deploy/soprano/values.yaml">Quick Start - EKS Audit logs</a>

## Deploy

Helm chart is located in deploy/soprano directory and you can easily setup the helm chart shown at below.

```sh
  $Â export BASE_PATH=$(PWD)/deploy/soprano
  
  $ helm upgrade -i aws-cw-prometheus-syncer ${BASE_PATH} -f ${BASE_PATH}/values.yaml
```

### Caveats 
To make this tool able to fetch the results of the CloudwatchInsights queries you should make sure the permissions are setup true.

### Permissions
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
      {
        "Sid": "LogGroupRetention",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
            "logs:Get*",
            "logs:Describe*",
            "logs:StartQuery",
            "logs:StopQuery",
            "logs:GetQueryResults",
            "cloudwathc:Get*"
        ]
        "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:log-group:LOG-GROUP-NAME"
      }
  ]
}
```

This tools is also able to access AWS API via  IRSA [Recommended way] assumed way so basically you can setup the IRSA like that;

```yaml
serviceAccount:
  create: true
  annotations:
    eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: ROLE_ARN
```

You can check the helm configuration details overs there ;

# TO-DO

* Helm Operator for the loki (on premise usage)
* ElasticSearch and Humio Support

<b>Important:</b>

To show respect to the James Gandolfini I keep the helm chart name as Soprano.
